=== Redirect-checker ===

A simple PHP app to trace the redirect steps of each URL in a list. The resulting display has been enhanced with color coding/icons for quick easy analysis. 

NOTE: There is no restriction on the number of URLs that can be entered in the text area. Timeouts may occur on large lists of URLs. 
This is dependent on your PHP server timeout setting. http://www.php.net/manual/en/info.configuration.php#ini.max-execution-time
